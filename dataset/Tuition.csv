Health & Human Services,None,Non-Degree,"EMDR INSTITUTE, INC",THE EMDR BASIC TRANING COURSE WEEKEND 1,"The EMDR Therapy Basic Training (Weekend 1 and 2) is designed for licensed mental health practitioners who treat adults and children in a clinical setting (See Qualifications Section). EMDR is a comprehensive psychotherapy that accelerates the treatment of a wide range of pathologies and self-esteem issues related to disturbing events and present life conditions. This interactional, standardized approach has been empirically tested in over 20 randomized controlled studies with trauma patients, and hundreds of published case reports evaluating a considerable range of presenting complaints, including depression, anxiety, phobias, excessive grief, somatic conditions and addictions. EMDR therapy is guided by the Adaptive Information Processing model which addresses the unprocessed memories that appear to set the basis for a wide range of dysfunction. A number of neurophysiological studies have documented the rapid post treatment EMDR effects.

GOAL OF THE EMDR THERAPY BASIC TRAINING
This experiential training will familiarize participants with a broad spectrum of EMDR therapy applications sufficient for comfortable and efficient use with a wide range patients and situations. Special attention will be given to the therapeutic needs of clients.

AUTHORIZED FORMAT
EMDR therapy is a specialized approach that requires supervised training for full therapeutic effectiveness and client safety. The training will consist of lecture, live and videotaped demonstrations and supervised practice. The format of this workshop has been designed by the originator of EMDRtherapy, Francine Shapiro, PhD. The workshop leaders have been individually selected and trained by her to provide the comprehensive information necessary for appropriate client selection and effective utilization of EMDR therapy. This is the workshop program which has been taught by Dr. Shapiro since 1990. EMDR Institute adheres to the ethical standards of APA, social work, nursing and mental health boards.

INTEGRATING EMDR THERAPY WITH OTHER APPROACHES
As an integrative psychotherapy approach, EMDR is compatible with all contemporary paradigms including, psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, experiential and systemic.

Description:
The objective of this course is to increase the existing individual skills of each student in combat marksmanship. Students will be introduced to new concepts and skills designed to increase speed, efficiency and accuracy while maintaining a focus on the combat application of each drill. Students will conduct collective progressive training under instructor supervision in order to gain proficiency prior to the testing phase. The testing phase will consist of students performing individual skills in gun handling and marksmanship while under induced stress from the Pro Timer. 
Methodology: 
During this course, students will be introduced to the Redback One Shooting System (RSS).
RSS is a complete training system that provides the end user with a consistent approach to the tactical employment of the M4 Carbine and issued pistol include; carriage, control, handling and operation.
By adopting the principles of RSS, the end user will be able to safely and confidently employ both weapons systems to a high degree of speed, efficiency and accuracy while operating in a tactical environment. 
All RSS techniques are simple to learn and replicate under stress. This is an important part of the methodology as many first responders and military personnel do not have the opportunity to conduct routine training in advanced weapons manipulation. With the Redback Training System (RTS) as the deliver vehicle combined with the instructional capability of the RB1 cadre, end users are able to receive and assimilate the information quickly.

This is an important part of the methodology as many first responders and military personnel do not have the opportunity to conduct routine training in advanced weapons manipulation. With the Redback Training System (RTS) as the deliver vehicle combined with the instructional capability of the RB1 cadre, end users are able to receive and assimilate the information quickly.
Demonstration Performance Method:
RB1 cadre will introduce each skill by explaining the purpose of the skill, why it is important to learn and how it can be applied in a combat situation. Students will then receive a demonstration detailing the standard to be achieved. Students will conduct collective and individual practice in each skill allowing them to achieve a proficient standard prior to being tested.

Using traditional reconstruction techniques such as momentum applications, an understanding of delta-V and PDOF and admissibility hearing issues unique to this technology as the basis for the course objectives, the CDR Data Analyst Certification course is both a natural extension of the CDR Technician training and an expansion of a reconstructionist's skill set. There is no hands on  downloading  activity in this class since it is assumed that those in attendance have recently completed the Technician course and understand that process along with the underlying concepts of data storage in the EDR subcomponent, CDR software troubleshooting and related error messages and their solution(s). For that reason, there is no need to bring a complete CDR Tool to this course. Activity in this course is focused on reading and understanding a CDR report then applying it to a normal, situationally complete reconstruction.

Working first with Vetronix and then with Bosch uninterrupted since 2000, CSI continues to offer the longest standing, unparalleled training and support on the Bosch CDR Tool.

Fire/Rescue Services,None,Non-Degree,ROPES THAT RESCUE LTD.,OFFSET/HIGHLINE RESCUE WORKSHOP,"For years, rope access technicians and emergency rope rescuers have asked for a training program on temporary rigging employing elevated rope tracking elements. In 2009 for the first time, RTR has put together just such a program. The OFFSET / HIGHLINE RESCUE WORKSHOP is just the type of program where these elevated options can be explored in the desert canyons of Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon, Arizona. The course begins with simple and easy to understand lessons on physics relative to ropes under tension used above the ground. The program moves between the subtle, yet substantial, differences between minor and major offsets and then moves into the distinctions between offsets and highlines. For rope access technicians, this course gives the student the groundwork for elevated transporting systems for men and/or materials used in work. Compounding forces on anchors and ensuring the means of not degrading the main tracking element are explored. Calculations are addressed concerning loading and how and when to bundle tracking elements to maintain an adequate safety margin.

It is designed for the serious rope rescue practitioner wishing to improve their personal rigging skill and capability. This workshop is sometimes mistakenly perceived as a beginning program due to the personal nature of many of the evolutions. In fact, it is for those that never seem to get enough on rope experience or time over the edge. The PSRW begins with valuable, yet simple definitions for belays, self belays, conditional belays and conditional self belays and how these differ in their engineering. It goes into important orientation on personally carried gear such as ascenders and descenders, self belay devices, Purcell prusiks, the all valuable AZTEK kit and other items essential to safety in the vertical realm and then moves into practical and fun-filled days where multiple one-on-one rope stations keep the practitioner busy throughout the day. Students in the PSRW practice their skills and learn to work together as a team in successful retrieval of this patient in a non-threatening environment. These are found in the Seven Minimalist Rescue Archetypes (7MRA) that lay a groundwork for understanding how solo versus semi-solo rescues vary in their risk to the rescuer. The PSRW goes well into often overlooked personal skills that are taken for granted on most rescue teams.There is also considerable time spent on rope learning to climb/descend rope by multiple methods (even improvised if you drop your friction appliance). Passing knots, deviations, rebelays, rope to rope transfers, aid climbing and problem solving are all part of the PSRW. Proficiency through repetition to mastery are encouraged. There is a very very strong emphasis on advanced knotcraft in this workshop! Students are tested throughout the program for proficiency and the ability to tie under pressure.",1250.00

Correction & Rehabilitation,None,Non-Degree,EMDR OF GREATER WASHINGTON,EMDR BASIC TRAINING,"Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), a contemporary approach to psychotherapy, accelerates the treatment of a wide range of psychosocial difficulties and self-esteem issues related both to past traumatic events and present life conditions. This interactive, standardized approach has been empirically tested with patients presenting with diverse issues, including loss of a loved one, rape, emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, vehicular, medical and other trauma, somatic disorders, relationship and performance difficulties. 
Controlled studies of survivors of Vietnam combat, rape, molestation, accident, catastrophic loss and natural disaster indicate that EMDR is capable of a rapid desensitization of traumatic memories, including a cognitive restructuring and a significant reduction of client symptoms such as emotional distress, intrusive thoughts, flashbacks and nightmares. Substantial research supports application of EMDR to trauma-related disorders. The International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS), the Dept of Veterans Affairs and DOD, The American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association have listed EMDR as efficacious in the treatment of PTSD.

EMDR has become invaluable for psychotherapists of all major orientations, including psychoanalytic, psychodynamic, cognitive/behavioral, somatic, and experiential/gestalt. It is a psychotherapy approach which is readily integrated into one's clinical practice and can be learned in a modest period of time.

This two-weekend intensive experiential training will introduce participants to the safe and efficient use of the EMDR approach with a wide range of patients and situations. This training program is approved by the EMDR International Association, a professional association which has established standards for EMDR practice and training. This course meets the basic training didactic and practice requirement towards EMDRIA certification. The instructor, Daniel Merlis, has 40 years of clinical/traumatology experience and has taught and practiced EMDR for 25 years.",2000.00

Police,Public Safety,Other,STREET COP TRAINING,THE STREET SMART COP/PRO-ACTIVE PATROL TACTICS,"The foundational course Street Cop Training was built on. Taken by over 10,000 law enforcement officers it has been regarded as the best course ever created for police officers. We have spent almost 20 years of collective information and fine tuning it to create a training experience like no other. Humorous, exciting, and extremely valuable, this course is designed to be enjoyed by every division and every rank. We will cover the case law every cop needs to know, specific to the state in which it's taught. The exposure to this kind of knowledge is a MUST have in today's modern policing. We can no longer afford to guess what to do next. Re-Active or Pro-Active, officers must know how to behave in a manner that is constitutionally compliant. We teach cases that not only give the student understanding but also raise their confidence. This will put an end to common police misconceptions and muster room debates. We supply facts and provide where it says what we teach and advocate.

We continue beyond case law into pro-active policing and how to be an effective police officer. The student will be privy to watching strategically edited police videos in a way that breaks down the indicators of criminal behavior. This is the perfect course for anyone looking to take their policing to the next level or looking to polish your existing abilities as an effective police officer. This course has been deemed so vital for police officers that several agencies have sent all their sworn personnel. Some have even added it as a pre-requisite to completing their field-training program. This course is not just for the proactive officers, as it provides essential information all LEO's must know. It is extremely dangerous for police officers to be in the presence of criminal activity without being aware of it. Save yourself from embarrassment. Save your life. Save the life of another.

Broadly covered topics will include; identity deception/uncovering the truth; reactions to police presence when engaged in criminal conduct; key phrases of deception; body language and nervous behavior; distinguishing illegal police conduct from legal police conduct; current crime trends; motor vehicle law that you should know; exposure to hidden compartments/hides; and Officer Safety/Tactics that will save your life. Previous attendees report back with great results far beyond what we ever expected this training to accomplish. Our students have stopped a broad range of crimes from being committed and have apprehended some of the most dangerous criminals in the country. Do not miss this career changing training.

Dennis Benigno is the founder and CEO of Street Cop Training and began formal police instruction in 2012. His law enforcement career began in 2001 at 19 years of age as a NJ Corrections Officer.

A peace officer needs to give his or her utmost in response, perception, decision-making and performance to protect him or herself as well as enforce public safety. Judgments passed on actions in these situations, whether in administrators' offices, courts, media coverage or among the public are often made long after the fact and without a foundation in the science of human behavior or performance under stress.

The Force Science Institute's certification program uses the combined knowledge of a team of world-class experts to explore the complex mix of human dynamics involved in the often complicated, confusing and controversial uses of force by law enforcement personnel.

The primary objective of the five-day course is to prepare law enforcement professionals to understand human factor dynamics more thoroughly and completely while investigating cases involving the use of force. This preparation allows graduates to draw clear, accurate and concise conclusions. Participants will learn to promote peak performance in pressure situations and learn what actually occurs in tense and emotionally charged use-of-force events. Enrollees will receive a window into the latest research on:

Skill acquisition.
Timing of interviews.
Decision-making.
Safety threats associated with prone subjects.
Traffic stop attacks.
Timing and dynamics of attack initiation.
How exhaustion impacts officer performance in force encounters.
The course will use this research and input from a group of experts to teach the following concepts and more:

Why individuals may recall facts they believe to be the truth when their accounts conflict with forensic evidence.
The advisability of making site visits or video reviews before a video statement is recorded.
What sleep and memory research says about timing interviews after significant events.
What stress-induced visual and auditory anomalies are, and how to deal with them during interviews.
Successful interview techniques for an accurate and thorough recollection of details in force encounters.
Whether shots to the back really reflect what shooters saw when they fired.
How to avoid critical mistakes during post-incident interviews.
The facts about use of force decisions: How long it takes to start and stop actions.
How to enhance decision-making through police officer training.

Police,Other/Misc.,Certificate,"Force Science Institute, LTD.",REALISTIC DE-ESCALATION INSTRUCTOR COURSE,"The Realistic De-Escalation Instructor Course thoroughly dissects the complex concept of  de-escalation  and the many elements in determining its feasibility or effectiveness in a variety of encounter types. This deeper knowledge of de-escalation is valuable to both line officers and the investigators and administrators called in to review force events after the fact. All these parties will need to determine to what extent using de-escalation techniques is feasible in specific high-pressure and rapidly unfolding encounters.

This course is designed for law enforcement trainers, whether they deal with street officers, field supervisors, investigators, attorneys, administrators or any other group within law enforcement. Instead of being based on the rhetoric that exists around the emotionally charged subject of police use-of-force encounters and the specter of excessive force, the curriculum is based on unbiased scientific realities. The Force Science Institute's research into human behavior as it applies to high-pressure encounters and de-escalation provides essential insights for law enforcement personnel at all levels and is designed to be the basis for de-escalation training for police.

Participants in the course will learn concepts and methods that support de-escalation efforts when personal connections can be made between officers and subjects. These attendees will be given knowledge regarding ways to help people in a state of mental health crisis, or whose perception of reality is altered. Law enforcement officers using the lessons from this course will be able to better manage human beings with better skills around establishing contact, building rapport and gaining influence to achieve police objectives.

Course Goal
The goal of this program is to equip professional trainers with the scientific knowledge of resolution methods for potentially violent confrontations between law officers and subjects. This information will help participants assess the circumstances accurately and defuse those situations without violence when possible, using easy-to-grasp and successfully applied tactics to receive voluntary compliance and prevent use-of-force crises from erupting.

Due to the course's focus on helping participants teach their colleagues the concepts of realistic de-escalation, the information can spread widely through police departments and law enforcement agencies. When departments incorporate de-escalation training for police informed by in-depth expert research, personnel are better prepared to deal with some of the most dangerous scenarios, not just to them but to public safety. This includes difficult cases such as  suicide by cop  calls and encounters in which the subject is experiencing an altered perception of reality.

Scenarios when subjects are in states such as  excited delirium  require specific approaches from responding personnel. When peace officer standards and training reflect these specific circumstances, there is a better chance for a successful resolution to even the most difficult encounters.

The ultimate goal of the Realistic De-Escalation Instructor Course is to more widely disseminate an understanding of the human factors and performance research data that can change and improve officers' approach to force encounters. To make these concepts into mainstays in law enforcement agencies around the country, those departments will need experienced and well-prepared trainers. Graduates of this course can take on those demanding educational roles, helping their students, in turn, avoid arrest-related deaths, as well as danger to themselves or harm to bystanders.

The foundational course Street Cop Training was built on. Taken by over 10,000 law enforcement officers it has been regarded as the best course ever created for police officers. We have spent almost 20 years of collective information and fine tuning it to create a training experience like no other. Humorous, exciting, and extremely valuable, this course is designed to be enjoyed by every division and every rank. We will cover the case law every cop needs to know, specific to the state in which it's taught. The exposure to this kind of knowledge is a MUST have in today's modern policing. We can no longer afford to guess what to do next. Re-Active or Pro-Active, officers must know how to behave in a manner that is constitutionally compliant. We teach cases that not only give the student understanding but also raise their confidence. This will put an end to common police misconceptions and muster room debates. We supply facts and provide where it says what we teach and advocate.
We continue beyond case law into pro-active policing and how to be an effective police officer. The student will be privy to watching strategically edited police videos in a way that breaks down the indicators of criminal behavior. This is the perfect course for anyone looking to take their policing to the next level or looking to polish your existing abilities as an effective police officer. This course has been deemed so vital for police officers that several agencies have sent all their sworn personnel. Some have even added it as a pre-requisite to completing their field-training program. This course is not just for the proactive officers, as it provides essential information all LEO's must know. It is extremely dangerous for police officers to be in the presence of criminal activity without being aware of it. Save yourself from embarrassment. Save your life. Save the life of another.
Broadly covered topics will include; identity deception/uncovering the truth; reactions to police presence when engaged in criminal conduct; key phrases of deception; body language and nervous behavior; distinguishing illegal police conduct from legal police conduct; current crime trends; motor vehicle law that you should know; exposure to hidden compartments/hides; and Officer Safety/Tactics that will save your life. Previous attendees report back with great results far beyond what we ever expected this training to accomplish. Our students have stopped a broad range of crimes from being committed and have apprehended some of the most dangerous criminals in the country. Do not miss this career changing training.

This will put an end to common police misconceptions and muster room debates. We only teach THE FACTS and provide legal citation and reference for where those facts came from. We make sure that every student is trained and versed in their state specific laws. A big misconception is that we only teach the state law in which we teach. That isn't true. The case law portion of this class only accounts for about 20% of the total program, making it very easy for us to teach in a universal manner.

Police,None,Non-Degree,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE,"Executive Women in Leadership Certificate (5 2-week long classes, total 50 hours) In many organizations, men hold more executive positions and board seats than similarly qualified women. Even organizations that bring on women and men at the same rate still demonstrate a gender imbalance at the highest levels of leadership because the power structures and gender dynamics in place often favor and reward the contributions of men over women. In this environment, even the most experienced and capable women struggle against gender bias and established power dynamics on their way to the top.

In this certificate, you will learn strategies and techniques to skillfully level the playing field as you work to attain higher levels of leadership. You'll begin with an evaluation of the gender bias and power dynamics present in your organizations and develop strategies to overcome their limiting effects. Next, you will assess and refine the way you present yourself as an executive. Leaders often have to negotiate on behalf of themselves, their teams, and their institutions, so students will explore ways to prepare for the challenges women face in negotiations and adapt their negotiation style to the context of a given situation. Given that strong professional networks are often required to advance careers to the highest level, you will create a plan to fully develop your own networks while navigating the potential traps of gender and power dynamics. Finally, you will peek behind the boardroom door to identify the key competencies needed for board membership and explore the various - and sometimes unlikely - pathways women follow to the boardroom. The certificate includes five (5) 2-week long courses: Power and Gender Dynamics; Developing Executive Presence for Women Leaders; Gender Bias and Negotiation Strategies; the Network Effect; Decoding the Gender Gap in Board Memebership.",2130.00

A peace officer needs to give his or her utmost in response, perception, decision-making and performance to protect him or herself as well as enforce public safety. Judgments passed on actions in these situations, whether in administrators' offices, courts, media coverage or among the public are often made long after the fact and without a foundation in the science of human behavior or performance under stress.

The Force Science Institute's certification program uses the combined knowledge of a team of world-class experts to explore the complex mix of human dynamics involved in the often complicated, confusing and controversial uses of force by law enforcement personnel.

The primary objective of the five-day course is to prepare law enforcement professionals to understand human factor dynamics more thoroughly and completely while investigating cases involving the use of force. This preparation allows graduates to draw clear, accurate and concise conclusions. Participants will learn to promote peak performance in pressure situations and learn what actually occurs in tense and emotionally charged use-of-force events.

Skill acquisition.

?

Timing of interviews.

?

Decision-making.

?

Safety threats associated with prone subjects.

?

Traffic stop attacks.

?

Timing and dynamics of attack initiation.

?

This deeper knowledge of de-escalation is valuable to both line officers and the investigators and administrators called in to review force events after the fact. All these parties will need to determine to what extent using de-escalation techniques is feasible in specific high-pressure and rapidly unfolding encounters.

This course is designed for law enforcement trainers, whether they deal with street officers, field supervisors, investigators, attorneys, administrators or any other group within law enforcement. Instead of being based on the rhetoric that exists around the emotionally charged subject of police use-of-force encounters and the specter of excessive force, the curriculum is based on unbiased scientific realities. The Force Science Institute's research into human behavior as it applies to high-pressure encounters and de-escalation provides essential insights for law enforcement personnel at all levels and is designed to be the basis for de-escalation training for police.

Participants in the course will learn concepts and methods that support de-escalation efforts when personal connections can be made between officers and subjects. These attendees will be given knowledge regarding ways to help people in a state of mental health crisis, or whose perception of reality is altered.

This is an introductory online 5-day course on Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy, the intervention model developed by Dr. Daniel Hughes.

This approach assists therapists and other professionals to understand and effectively support children, young people and their families. In this model, theory and research in the areas of developmental trauma, attachment theory, intersubjectivity and child development are integrated to produce a therapeutic approach used for relationship development and trauma resolution. DDP recognises the vital role which adoptive parents, foster carers and residential workers play as primary attachment figures in the recovery of traumatized, attachment-resistant children.

The principles and interventions are presented through formal presentations, discussion, videotape of sessions, role-play, and hand outs.

Who is it for?

This course is suitable for parents, social workers, child and youth workers, caregivers or teachers working with children with attachment issues. This training is also relevant for therapists and clinicians who want to increase their skill set of attachment focused treatment. The model is relevant for those working with children aged four through to adult years. This is phase one of certification in DDP Training and as being held online is limited to 12 participants.

Please note that while Level One and Two are open access for professionals working with children and families, there are specific requirements that need to be fulfilled for those who plan to go on to apply for certification as a Practitioner in DDP. Please refer to What is required before starting the practicum for further information.

Module 4 | ACT for All Populations
Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a unique and innovative approach that helps clients to fundamentally change their relationship with their thoughts and feelings; to live in the present moment; to stop reacting and start responding; and to allow their values to guide them in a more rich and meaningful life. In ACT, clients utilize skills in mindfulness to accept the painful aspects of their lives while at the same time reducing the experiential avoidance that causes suffering. In other words,  Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.  Move your clients toward focusing on identifying what matters in their lives and taking actions in service of those values.

In this recording Sydney Kroll, PsyD, shares an introduction to the research and theory behind ACT so you can clearly articulate the empirical evidence for this model. Experiential and engaging activities are used throughout the course to illustrate specific techniques and concepts. Dr. Kroll shows you how to apply these strategies to virtually any client population. Walk away with the skills and tangible resources to use immediately in your practice for better client outcomes and a greater sense of purpose as a clinician.

Module 5 | ACT for Body Acceptance
Clients are swimming upstream when it comes to positive body image. Hounded with unattainable white western standards about what constitutes an acceptable body, many stop pursuing the life they want. And at the same time, clients can feel shame that they struggle with body positivity and may blame themselves for being stuck. This session will teach you strategies from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to help clients accept the body they inhabit and use it to pursue meaningful activities even as they experience distressing thoughts, feelings, and memories.

Program Information
Objectives

Determine the role of avoidance of thoughts and feelings about body image in keeping clients stuck.

ACT With Anxiety: An Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Workbook to Get You Unstuck from Anxiety and Enrich Your Life
Anxiety, in all its various forms, is one of the most common mental health challenges today. Although many of us attempt to deal with anxiety by pushing it away or trying to avoid it altogether, this often has the paradoxical effect of making it worse. Worrying sparks anxiety, and anxiety sparks more worrying, and our lives become smaller. Fortunately, new research reveals how to break free from the anxiety trap.

In this engaging and easy-to-read workbook, Dr. Sears provides detailed explanations, case examples, and practical worksheets to show you how to work with your anxiety instead of trying to battle against it. Using cutting-edge techniques and principles, you'll learn tools to transform anxiety and create a richer and more fulfilling life.

Hope for Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Sensorimotor Approach to Change
The very nature of depression often thwarts efforts to treat it. After all, it's difficult to change when you have no energy, no hope, and no capacity to concentrate. How can we challenge these chronic states?

You'll discover how to:

Help clients separate depressive thoughts from physical symptoms so that each can be treated separately
Counter cognitive beliefs that reinforce depressive states by experimenting with new words, new actions, and new habits
Use body-centered interventions, such as movement, to increase energy and focus in depressed clients
Facilitate development of an  antidepressant lifestyle  rather than habitual engagement in the opposite
