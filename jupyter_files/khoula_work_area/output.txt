British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.

The reddish sunsets were the result of wildfires in Siberia. The fires were started by farmers burning grass in their fields. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. The lingering smoke from the fires was picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues and purples.

Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of a 17th-century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman-Habsburg war. They believe the camel may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683. Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian-dromedary hybrid – a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time. The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated. The remarkable find was made during an archaeological dig that took place amid preparations for a new shopping centre.
